# Guide to Programming Exercises

Programming exercises aim to help you practice the concepts taught in the course.  They are designed to be completed within a day.  You are encouraged to discuss and seek help from others if you get stuck.  However, you should ensure that you understand the resulting code and the concepts behind them, and not just copying the code blindly.

## GitHub Setup 

You need a one-time setup at the beginning of the semester to link your PE account to your GitHub account.  Follow [the instructions here](github.md) to set up your GitHub account for CS2030S.

## Vim Setup 

You need a one-time setup at the beginning of the semester to install the standard vim configuration, color schemes, and plugins.  Follow [the instructions here](vim/setup.md) to set up your Vim for CS2030S.

You will not be able to retrieve an exercise if the expected Vim-related directory cannot be found. 

## GitHub Classroom

We will use GitHub Classroom for our exercise release and submission for CS2030S.

Here are what you need to do for every exercise:

### 1. Accept the Exercise

Make sure that you have logged into GitHub.

_If you have multiple GitHub accounts, make sure you use the one with the same GitHub username you have submitted to us_.

Click on the given URL to accept the exercise. 

A repo will be created automatically for you.

!!! warning "WARNING"
    Do not interact with the repo directory using GitHub or other `git` commands.

### 2. Read and Understand the Exercise Task

The exercise task will be given in a link on Canvas.

Read through the question carefully before starting to complete the task.

### 3. Get a Copy on PE Hosts

Run the command `/opt/course/cs2030s/get exX` (where X is the exercise number) to clone a copy of the exercise on your home directory.  You will see a new directory named something like `exX-username` created, with the skeleton files inside.

You need to edit, compile, run, and test your code on the PE hosts.

!!! warning "WARNING"
    Do not edit your code directly on GitHub.

### 4. Check You Work

You can following the instructions in the exercise task to compile and test your code locally on the PE hosts.  

For a more comphensive check, you can run the command `/opt/courss/cs2030s/check exX` (where X is the exercise number).  This will run a series of style checks, compilation checks, and test cases on your code.  

### 4. Submit a Copy 

When you are ready to submit, run `/opt/courss/cs2030s/submit exX` (where X is the exercise number).  This will do the following:

- Runs `/opt/course/cs2030s/check` on your code
- Generate a report 
- Submit a copy of the code and the report to GitHub.  You can submit multiple times, but only the last copy will be processed by the tutor .

!!! warning "WARNING"
    Do not use `git push` or other `git` commands to submit your code to GitHub.

### 5. Receiving Feedback

The tutors will provide feedback on your submission via Github after the deadline.  You can reply to their comment, etc, on GitHub as well. 

!!! warning "WARNING"
    You should not change your code on GitHub after the deadline (by either re-running `submit` or using `git` commands directly) to avoid interfering with the feedback process.

### 6. Feedback Report and Achievement Badges

A file named `feedback.md` that contains auto-graded output as well as links to your tutor's feedback will be placed into your GitHub repo.  

We will assign an achievement badge, which can be one of the following:

  * **Excellent** Compiles without warning or style errors. Pass all test cases.
  * **Good** Compiles with one or more warnings or style errors. Pass all test cases.
  * **Need Improvement** Fail one or more test cases (including internal test cases)
  * **N/A** Late submission; Submitted skeleton only; No submission; Submitted non-compilable code.

These achievement badges help us keep track of the students' progress and give students a sense of their learning.  They do not contribute to the final grade.

### Warning

Let us repeat: You should only interact with your submissions on GitHub using the provided scripts `get` and `submit`.  Failure to do so will break our workflow and will not be appreciated.

If you accidentally break your repo by running `git` commands on it or edit it directly on GitHub, you should save a copy of your code elsewhere, then reset your exercise directory, by (i) requesting your tutor to delete the repo on GitHub, (ii) deleting the corrupted directory on PE nodes, (iii) go through Steps 1 and 2 again, then copy back your edited code into the directory.

## Timeline

The exercise is usually due on Tuesday afternoon, in the week following its released.  You must submit each exercise before the deadline to receive feedback from your tutors and your achievement badge.

The tutors have the right to refuse to read and give feedback on late submissions.

## General Advice

You are advised to (i) spend some time thinking before you begin coding, (ii) practice incremental coding, and (iii) test your programs thoroughly.

Remember to spend some time thinking about the design and approach to solving each question.

Incremental coding means do NOT type in the whole long program in a single session and then compile it. Instead, type your program in bits and pieces and compile it incrementally. Try to maintain a compilable program even while you are working on it. Submitting a compilable program that partially works is better than submitting an un-compilable one; this is especially important for your practical exams.

You should test your program thoroughly with your test data before submission.

You may assume that all input data are correct unless otherwise stated. Hence, you do NOT need to do input data validation. This is to allow you to focus on getting the program right, instead of worrying about making your program fool-proof.

## Seeking Help from Others

We encourage students to discuss and seek help from each other, from the lab tutors, or from an AI, if they are stuck.  However, do note that students are responsibile to ensure that they understand the resulting code they produce and the concepts behind them, and not just copying the code blindly.  

The exercises are meant to help you learn and practice the concepts taught in the course.  The exercises do not contribute to the final grade and therefore there is no point in plagiarizing code to solve the questions.  

All exercises are designed to be completed within half a day.  If you get stuck on an issue for longer than that, you should talk to others.

## Method of Submission

Please follow the instructions above to submit your code to the tutors for comments.  Programs submitted through other means, such as emails, will NOT be accepted.

## Use of Ed

If you have doubts about the problem statements of an exercise, you may raise them on Ed.  But before that, please read through the problem statements carefully first, and check if the same questions have been asked and answered on the forum.

Please exercise discretion when posting to Ed.  Before the deadline, if you need to post your solution, complete or partial, please use the spoiler" feature.
