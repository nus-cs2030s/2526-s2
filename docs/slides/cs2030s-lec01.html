- No late submission or makeup quizzes

---
class: top

### Lab Practicals

- In-lab programming test

- Simulate practical exams

- 7 graded practicals over the semester (scored at least 70% for full marks)

---
class: top

### Programming Exercises

The most important and useful component of CS2030S.

We have many programming questions. Practice and learn.

---
### Plagiarism Policy

- All weighted formative and summative assessments must be individual work.

- We encourage discussion for formative assessments (except for graded in-lab practicals) but do not share code.

- Disciplinary actions will be taken against plagiarism.

---
### Use of AI

- Be familiar with NUS policy on AI usage.

- You may use AI tools to assist your learning. 

- Example: OK to ask AI tools for explanations of concepts.  Not for solutions to assignments.

- AI is not available during summative assessments.  Do not become dependent on it.

Real-world software is complex, evolves continuously, and is a product of team work. 

---
class: top

CS2030S teaches you how to write better code, where "better" means:

- more human-friendly
- easier to change and maintain
- fewer crashes

through programming paradigms, idioms, and language design.

---
class: top

CS2030S is not a course about 

- algorithms or efficiency
- software design 
- Java language and libraries

---
class: middle, center

## Lecture 1

### 12 January 2026

---
After this lecture, you should understand the following differently from CS1101S:

- think in terms of types, compilation, and abstraction boundaries, not just “does it run correctly”

- errors are not just bugs; some are preventable by language design.


---
class: middle,center

## How We Run Programs

### The `javac` Compiler

### The `java` Runtime

### The `jshell` Runtime

---
class: top

The compiler is our friend

- it helps us catch errors early

- but can only be based on the code, not by running it

We will learn programming language features that allow compiler to catch more errors during compilation.

## Variable

### Abstraction over Data

---
### Recall Typed Source from CS1101S

<center>
<img src="figures/cs2030s-lec01/typescript.png" width="700">

---
class: top

### Type

- The _type_ of a variable decides the computation that can be performed on the variable.

- The _type_ of a value decides the computation that can be performed on the value.


---
class: top

### Type system

- A type system is a set of rules about types of variables, values, expression, functions, and their interactions.

---
class: center,middle

## Static vs. Dynamic Typed Language

---
class: top

### Dynamically Typed

- The type of a variable is associated with the value it currently holds.

```javascript
let x = 4;  // x is an integer
x = "5";    // x is now a string
```

---
class: top

### Statically Typed

- The type of a variable is declared and is fixed.

```Java
int x = 4;  // x is an int
x = "5";    // error
"x is " + x // error
```

---
class: top

### When a dynamically type language is annoying:

```Python
x = 0
while x &lt; 100:
  x = something_slow()
print("x is " + x)
```

---

### Java is a _statically typed_ language.

- The type assigned to variable during declaration is called the _compile-time type_.

- The type of the value assigned to the variable during execution is called the _runtime type_.

---
class: center,middle

## Strong vs. Weak Typing 

---
class: top

### Weak Typing

- Allow flexible conversion between types 

- For Example, in C:

```C
int x;
x = 4;
x = (int)"5"; // okay, fine..
```

---
class: top

### Strong typing

- Strict rules about conversions between types

- For example, in Java

```Java
int x;
x = 4;
x = (int)"5"; // error
```

---
class: top

### Primitive Types in Java

- `byte`, `short`,  `int`, `long` 

- `float`, `double`

- `char`

- `boolean`

---
class: top

### Primitive types in Java do not share their values

```Java
int i = 10;
int j = i;
i = i + 1;
```

| Data Type | Size | Minimum Value                  | Maximum Value                  |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

| `double`  | 64 bits        | Approx. -1.8e+308              | Approx. 1.8e+308              |

class: top

```Java
byte b = 10;
int i = 1000;
b = i; // error
i = b; // oK
```

---
class: top

### Poll

```Java
byte b = 10;
int i = 10;
b = i; // ok?
i = b; // ok
```

--
The compiler checks based on the compile-time type only.

---
class: top

### Subtype and Supertype

A type $T$ is a _subtype_ of $S$ ($T <: S$) if:

- a piece of code written for variables of type $S$ can also safely be used on variables of type $T$. 

$S$ is a _supertype_ of $T$.


---
class: top

### Subtyping Among Java Primitive Types

- `byte` $<:$ `short` $<:$ `int` $<:$ `long`
- `long` $<:$ `float` $<:$ `double`
- `char` $<:$ `int`

---
class: top

### Subtyping is Reflexive and Transitive

- $T <: T$
- if $S <: T$ and $T <: U$, then $S <: U$.

---
class: top

### Java Widening Type Conversion 

During execution (runtime),  Java only allows putting a value of type $T$ into a variable of type $S$ iff $T <: S$.

---
class: middle,center

## Function

### Abstraction over Computation

---
class: top

.smaller[
```javascript
// find 10!
let i = 10;
let fac10 = 1;
while (i >= 0) {
  fac10 = fac10 * i;
  i = i - 1;
}
// find 5!
i = 5;
let fac5 = 1;
while (i >= 0) {
  fac5 = fac5 * i;
  i = i - 1;
}
```
]

---
class: top

.small[
```javascript
function factorial(i) {
  let fac = 1;
  while (i >= 0) {
    fac = fac * i;
    i = i - 1;
  }
  return fac;
}
const fac10 = factorial(10);
const fac5 = factorial(5);
```
]

---
class: top,center

### Function as an abstraction barrier

---

### Function in Java

```Java
int foo(int i) {
  return i;
}
```

The return type and the parameter type(s) enforces what kinds of inputs are allowed and what kind of results can be expected.

---

### Poll 

```Java
short x = 1;
foo(x); // ok?

long y = 1;
foo(y); // ok?
```

---
class: middle,center

## Abstraction:<br>Composite Data Type

---
class: top

### Encapsulation

- Bundle related variables and functions together to create a _class_

---
class: center, middle
<img src="figures/cs2030s-lec01/js-circle.png" width="800">

---
class: top

In Java, the keyword `class` allows us to define a new class named `Circle`.

```Java
class Circle {
  double x;
  double y;
  double radius;
}
```

---
class: top

```Java
class Circle {
  double x;
  double y;
  double radius;
  
  double getArea() {
    return 3.1415926 * radius * radius;
  }
}
```

---
class: top

In Java classes:

 - The bundled functions are called _methods_
 
 - The bundled variables are called _fields_

---
class: top

Objects are instances of a class.

In Java, the keyword `new` creates (or _instantiates_) an object of a given class.
```Java
Circle c = new Circle();
```

---
class: top

We use the dot notation to access the field or call the method of an object.

```Java
Circle c = new Circle();
c.r = 10;
double area = c.getArea();
```

---

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- The code is organised into classes.

- A program runs by instantiating objects of different classes.

- These objects interact with each other by calling each others' methods.

---
class: top
### Java Reference Types

- Every type that is not a primitive type is a reference type.

- A reference variable stores only the reference to the value, not the value itself.

.smaller[
```Java
Circle c1 = new Circle();
Circle c2 = c1;
System.out.println(c2.r); // print 0
c1.r = 10.0;
System.out.println(c2.r); // print 10.0
```
]

---
class: top, wide

What happens if we don't initialise a reference field?

```Java
class A {
  Circle c1;
   :
  c1.r = 10.0;  // NullPointerException
}
```

All non-initialised reference fields will have the special reference value `null`.
